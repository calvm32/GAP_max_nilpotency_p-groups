  [33X[0;0YThe  generic representation of wreath product elements in wreath products of
  finite  groups  and in particular their (sparse) wreath cycle decompositions
  can be used to speed up certain computations in wreath products.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn   particular   this   package  provides  efficient  methods  for  finding
  conjugating    elements,    conjugacy   classes,   and   centralisers.   The
  implementations are based on [BNRW22] and references therein.[133X

  [33X[0;0YHere  we  include  a  list  of operations that take advantage of the generic
  representation of wreath product elements.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  include  python scripts in the [10Xdev/[110X directory that benchmark the [5XWPE[105X and
  native [5XGAP[105X implementations of these operations separately. The comparison of
  the  runtimes  supports  the  conclusion that the [5XWPE[105X implementations are an
  order  of  magnitude  faster than the native [5XGAP[105X implementations. We can now
  solve  these  computational  tasks  for  large  wreath  products  that  were
  previously not feasible in [5XGAP[105X[133X
